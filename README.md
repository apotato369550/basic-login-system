A basic account-signup, login, logout, and delete system made with HTML, CSS, and PHP

# Hi

This is a basic account creation system build with HTML, CSS, and PHP (with some SQL). The site also has a mailer system.

To set it up, run it on a web server. You'll also need to create the databases where the accounts & requests will be saved. (More on that later)

The system has a built-in mailer, so you'll need to edit the source code to provide your email and password and such in the "-request.inc.php" files (I'll put an indicator)

This is one of my starter projects. It's very buggy and messy, but I'm proud of it. Hope you enjoy.
